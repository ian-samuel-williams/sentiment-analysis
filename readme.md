#Sentiment Analysis On Song Lyrics

The classic saying “you are what you eat” essentially means that your 
personal health can be quite easily controlled, to an extent, by what 
foods you decide to eat. It’s often told to kids who are quick to exchange 
healthier foods for foods higher in sugar content and fat in their diet. I 
believe however that another similar expression can be made: you are what 
you listen to. Because we take in these lyrics that we listen to, one 
could argue that it would be good to take an evaluation of the emotions 
portrayed and expressed in the songs one spends large amounts of time 
listening to. 

I decided to take a deeper look into the music I listen to, with the goal 
of viewing how positive or negative the emotions expressed in my 
most-listened to songs are. Music has had a large influence in my life, 
with my parents even warning me at an earlier age that negative music 
would lead me down a darker path. I decided to attempt to figure out 
exactly how negative the music I listened to was, from a completely 
unbiased perspective.
